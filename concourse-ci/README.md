# Overview

Proof of concept is up at [https://ci.ific-invisible-cities.com/](https://ci.ific-invisible-cities.com/). It's password protected, ask @mmkekic for access if you want to poke around, authorization for the real version would be mediated via oauth by membership in the [nextic github organization](https://github.com/nextic).

This sets up an example CI pipeline for the invisible cities project. The idea is that, whenever a pull request to a [protected branch](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-protected-branches) happens:

1. the CI runs the unit tests (currently what your travis CI runs) and errors out if they fail
2. if unit tests pass, the CI submits a job to the majorana cluster that performs sanity checks; a report is generated and put somewhere (eg. a gce bucket)
3. If the sanity checks also pass, the CI marks the PR as approved in github and the merge can now be performed.

I've got 2 pipelines, which is what I generally do:
* the PR pipeline builds pull requests and blocks merges of failed PRs
* another pipeline builds a branch every 24 hours; this way changes in dependencies that break your build get caught early.

I set this up using [concourse](https://concourse-ci.org/) because:
* as a side effect of dragging my current company's devs into the 19th century, I can now set up continuous integration environments based on concourse in my sleep
* concourse is awesome; it does have a learning curve (as do all CI tools) but it's very flexible and forces you to decouple stuff in a way that makes deploying in cloud environments easy.

I left a placeholder script to represent job submission/result gathering from the cluster; this basically means automating via bash whatever you guys do to launch a job and collect the results.

# Usage

## Online demo version

The concourse interface is up at [https://ci.ific-invisible-cities.com/](https://ci.ific-invisible-cities.com/).

The easiest way to understand what's going on is just to open a test PR to the master branch in the [https://github.com/miguelsimon/IC](https://github.com/miguelsimon/IC) repo, you should see:
* Merges are disallowed until the build passes
* At least 1 review is required.

## Walkthrough for executing concourse locally

### Prerequisites

* [docker-compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-18-04)
* make ie if you're on some unix flavor you're fine

These steps must be executed from within this directory:

1. launch the local concourse instance:
  `docker-compose up -d`
2. navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and login with username: test password: test
3. download the [fly cli](https://concourse-ci.org/fly.html) from your local concourse installation
4. log in to concourse via the command line:
  `fly -t local login -c http://localhost:8080`
5. push the build pipeline (the other requires a credential you don't have):
  `make set_local_build_pipeline`

Voil√†, you can now unpause the pipeline. The invisible cities tests should run (I'm basically doing the same thing your travis CI is doing).

## Running on a server

I've set it up at [https://ci.ific-invisible-cities.com/](https://ci.ific-invisible-cities.com/).

Doing that involves quite a bit of onerous and annoying details, dealing with dns, certificates, hosting etc. These are just annoying if you know what you're doing but require loads of time to learn all that boring trivia if you don't. I can talk to you guys and help you set it up in your context.

The set up is mostly sane but the top priority was getting it working in < 3 hours so I'm mainly using stuff I'm comfortable with.

Birds-eye overview of the current setup:
* The deploy is specified in docker compose; I'm running postgres, concourse, an nginx frontend and [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) to set up free certificates via letsencrypt.
* I'm running it on a trial google compute engine VM (google cloud is a very sane cloud provider when compared to others *cough* amazon *cough*)
* access control is via username - password now, we'd delegate access control to github via oauth to avoid operational hassles

## fly execute for cluster tests

To test the `cluster-tests.sh` script it's convenient to launch it using local content; you can do this via fly execute (if you've got the proper credentials); the following example uses the current IC checkout to populate both the IC and IC_master inputs to the script:

```
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat credentials/key_concourse) \
	fly -t local execute \
		--include-ignored \
		--input IC=../ \
  	--input IC_master=../ \
		--config cluster-tests.yml
```
